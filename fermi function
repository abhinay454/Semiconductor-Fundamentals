Dear hadi,
You can solve this problem as follows:
You are given that the intrinsic  concentration ni as
ni^2 = Nc Nv exp - Eg/kT if Eg is measured in electron volt  eV, kT must be also in eV,
It is known that the Nc= Ac N^3/2, Nv=Av T^3/2, Ac and Av are known constants since Nc and Nv  are known at room temperature T= 300 K.
To get the requited temperature T you need only to:
ni = Na or Nd. If you have curve for ni as a  function of T you can read the temperature corresponding to certain ni = Nd or Na.
wish you success
